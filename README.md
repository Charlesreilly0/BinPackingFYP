# Project Name

This is the code for MSc project title: "Adversial Search Techniques For Approximating The One-dimensional bin packing problem.

## Installation
For easy testing:

Prerequisite: Install cmake, python3 and G++

A.1) Download the repository and open the parent directory.

A.2) Run the following the commands.

    - cd build
    
    - cmake ..
    
    - cmake --build .
    
    - ./BinPackingGame <Bin Capacity> <Best Known Solution> <List of Items (Comma-Seperated)> <Name of Algorithm> <Name of Data Structure> <Y/N>
    
A.3) You can simply use the juypter notebook (../tests/test.ipynb) to test the application on all the dataset.

For full testing:
B.1) Repeat step (A.1) and (A.2)

B.2) Run chmod +x ./build/BinPackingGame

B.3) Run Python3 app.py

B.4) Define the content of the visualization.py for plotting data.     \\ Examples have been provided in example.ipynb
B.5) Define the contetn of the statistcal_analysis.py for stats.       \\


B.6) Open in localhost browser once server is running.
